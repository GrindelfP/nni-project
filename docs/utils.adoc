== Function: `f`

Calculates the natural logarithm of a given number.

=== Parameters

* `x`: The input value for which the natural logarithm is computed. Must be a positive number.

=== Returns

The natural logarithm of the input value.

== Function: `generate_dataset`

Generates a dataset of random values and their corresponding function outputs.

=== Parameters

* `size`: The number of data points to generate.
* `func`: A function that takes a float as input and returns a float as output. This function will be applied to each random value generated.
* `lower`: The lower bound for the range from which random values are generated. Defaults to 0.
* `upper`: The upper bound for the range from which random values are generated. Defaults to 1.

=== Returns

A list of tuples where each tuple contains a random float and the result of applying the `func` to that float.
